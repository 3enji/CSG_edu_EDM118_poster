        <p>
          This encompasses knowledge, skills, education, and any

          There is a clear correlation between educational attainment and a

          local economic activity rate, the percentage of the population
          claiming benefits and/or in social housing, health scores, teenage
          pregnancy rates, etc. (Smith, 2012)

            Have a tendency to work while in HE to support themselves

          <li>
            May experience difficulty in mixing socially, resulting in social

            social skills are required to navigate this.

          <li>
            May aspire to establish a different identity from their family

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Deficits of cultural capital</strong> may affect whether
          potential students apply to university in the first place, which
          institutions they apply to and what they understand before beginning
          (the first two points are beyond the PT's control).

          <h3>4. The vital role of personal tutors in student success</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          <strong>Direct Student Interaction:</strong> PTs have regular contact
          with students, allowing them to build meaningful relationships and
          provide tailored guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Holistic Understanding:</strong> the role of PT provides a
          broader picture of students' academic and personal challenges,
          ensuring a well-rounded support system.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Trust and Approachability:</strong> through sustained
          interactions, PTs can develop trust, making students more likely to
          seek help when needed (Fukuyama, 1995; Putnam, 2000).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Institutional Knowledge:</strong> PTs understand HE structures
          and services, making them well equipped to signpost students to
          relevant resources and support networks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Academic and Non-Cognitive Skill Development:</strong> PTs can
          provide structured guidance on study strategies, time management, and
          professional networking, enhancing students' long-term success (Dweck
          et al., 2014; Farrington et al., 2012; Luthar et al., 2015).
