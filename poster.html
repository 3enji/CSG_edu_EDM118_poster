          This encompasses knowledge, skills, education, and any advantages a

          deprivation are highly correlated: local economic activity rate,
          percentage of the population claiming benefits and/or in social
          housing, health scores, teenage pregnancy rates, etc. (Smith, 2012)

        <header><h3>2. Relevance for individuals and institutions</h3></header>
        <p>
          Many students from disadvantaged backgrounds lack the knowledge and
          ability that students from relatively advantaged backgrounds possess,
          facilitating success at university and allowing for the further
          accumulation of cultural capital while experiencing HE—first
          characterised as cultural capital by Bourdieu (1979).
        </p>

        <p>
          More of an issue in the context of modern higher education due to
          widening participation and an increase in the number of
          'Non-traditional' students from areas with historically low
          participation rates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deficits of cultural capital may affect young people applying to
          university in the first place, which institutions they apply to, and
          what they understand before beginning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Social disadvantage may impact behaviour, attendance, and course
          completion. Low attainment is linked to social disadvantage.
        </p>

        <p>
          Universities are obliged to ensure students are not disadvantaged and
          must implement an
          <strong>Office for Students' Access and Participation Plan</strong> if
          they charge the highest-level tuition fees.
        </p>

        <p>
          Teachers who understand diverse backgrounds are more likely to 'create
          learning environments and teaching strategies' that suit all.

        <header><h3>Risk Factors for Course Failure or Withdrawal</h3></header>
        <p>
          Lochtie et al (2019) categorise a series of risk factors, the
          interplay between which may place a student at risk of course failure
          or withdrawal:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Student characteristics:</strong> a history of
            alcohol/substance abuse, disability, mental health, part-time,
            mature, previous offender
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Home life:</strong> abusive relationships, care leaver,
            homelessness, pregnant/parent, commuter/lives with parent
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cultural/economic factors:</strong> socioeconomic groups
            D/E, ethnic minority, asylum seeker, international
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section class="custom-section">
        <header><h3>3. Why personal tutors?</h3></header>
        <p>
          <strong>Direct Student Interaction:</strong> Personal tutors have
          regular contact with students, allowing them to build meaningful
          relationships and provide tailored guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Holistic Understanding:</strong> Their role enables them to
          see the broader picture of a student's academic and personal
          challenges, ensuring a well-rounded support system.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Trust and Approachability:</strong> Through sustained
          interactions, tutors can develop trust, making students more likely to
          seek help when needed (Fukuyama, 1995; Putnam, 2000).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Institutional Knowledge:</strong> Tutors understand university
          structures and services, making them well-equipped to signpost
          students to relevant resources and support networks (Simon et al.,
          2021).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Academic and Non-Cognitive Skill Development:</strong> They
          can provide structured guidance on study strategies, time management,
          and professional networking, enhancing students' long-term success
          (Dweck et al., 2014; Farrington et al., 2012; Luthar et al., 2015).

        <p>
          Key findings from a study by Hockings et al (2007) into the experience
          of non-traditional students:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            A tendency to work while at university to support themselves
            independently and ramifications of this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sometimes experience difficulty in mixing socially, which results in
            social isolation and can impact 'confidence and commitment to their
            course' - social skills are required to navigate this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Establishing a different identity from family background was seen as
            an aspiration for some but tended to alienate former peers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Expected fair treatment, not to be patronised, while recognising
            that differential treatment might be meeting individual needs rather
            than singling out.
